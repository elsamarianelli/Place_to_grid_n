function [p, d] = pxd(spikes, times)
% PXD Calcs & plots ML estimates of true spatial & dir firing plots
%
% Generates and plots the fields and polar_plot resulting from a maximum
% likelihood factorial model of influences of place (p) and direction (d)
% on cell firing, assuming Poisson noise. Standard (spikes/dwell_time)
% plots are also shown for comparison. See Burgess, Cacucci, Lever, O'Keefe
% Hippocampus (2005) for details of procedure, although slightly different
% binning and smoothing of data is used in this reference.
%
% The algorithm is run until the fractional change in the likelihood of the
% data is less than 'accuracy' (e.g. 0.00001, i.e. until 'convergence') or
% for max_iter iterations (e.g. 1000, i.e. 'non-convergence').
%
% The pxd ratemap and polar data are plotted along with the standard p,d
% for comparison. All are smoothed by the specified boxcars.
%
% IMPORTANT. Spatial bins shouldn't be too small - specifically if there
% are too many spatial bins then the result will be unstable. Suggest
% setting bin size so number of spatial bins does not exceed 30 x 30 (so
% roughly 3cm bins in a 1m square). Directional bin size is less
% problematic.
%
% ARGS
% spikes    [n_dir_bins x n_posY_bins x n_posX_bins] Hist of spike count in
%           the 3D matrix defining place by direction. Will typically be
%           generated using histnd.m
%
% times     [same dim as spikes] Similar to spikes but the dwell time
%           counts for those bins. This should be in seconds not pos samp.
%
%
% RETURNS
% p         [y_bins x x_bins] Unsmoothed positional firing ratemap
% d         [1 x d_bins] Unsmoothed directional firing ratemap
%
% Use e.g.:
% [p, d] = pxd(spikes, times);
%
% NB is closely based on Neil's original code used by MIA for mTint which
% can be found in mTint repository.
