Example_Data
=============

Several sets of single unit data (recorded using Axona system) which can be used to test the basic read in functions as well as functions for making rate maps etc.


**gridCell1838_t2c3_14-12-10.mat**
Data which has already been loaded into matlab (and partially processed) using read_DACQ.m which in turn calls the function in DACQ_core_functions. This animal had a grid cell on tetrode 2, cell 3. Loading the MAT into matlab will create four variables in the workspace. These are as follows:

1) data - this is the main data structure which is the basic read in functions create in matlab when loading Axona data. The data structure contains information about the animalâ€™s movements (data.pos), action potentials and spike times (data.tetrode), and LFP (data.eeg)

2) exactCut - this is created by read_cut_file.m and is the contents of a single .cut file (as saved by Tint). exactCut specifies for each action potential recorded on a specific tetrode (this one is for tetrode 2) the cell that it is assigned to (where cell 0 is the junk cluster - note for data clustered using KlusterKwik cell 1 is the junk cluster). In this data cell 3 is a grid cell.

3) smthRm - is a smoothed ratemap created using make_smooth_ratemap.m (or its precursor) for the grid cell which is cell 3 on tetrode 2.

4) spikePosSamp - is for each of the action potentials that belong to cell 3 on tetrode 2 the matching pos sample (i.e. index into data.pos.xy)




**r1838_10-12-14** Folder containing data recorded by CB on 10/12/14 from r1838 using an Axona recording system. This data can be read into generate the standard data structure (ie. data.pos etc and data.tetrode etc) using the read_DACQ.m function (will in turn calls many of the functions in the DACQ_core_functions folder).

In brief this animal had 8 tetrodes, the first 4 in MEC and the second 4 in HPC. The folder contains cut files (xxx.cut) for each of these tetrodes, the raw spike data (files ending in a number from 1 to 8), LFP data from 3 electrodes (save at 250Hz in the eeg files and 4.8kHz in the egf files), position data (in .pos) and basic settings info (in .set).

This animal has a number of grid cells specified by the following tetrode cell pairs (i.e. first number is tetrode and second is cell): 11, 13, 21, 22, 23, 26, 28, 44
