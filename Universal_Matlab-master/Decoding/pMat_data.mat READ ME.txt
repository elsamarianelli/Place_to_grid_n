This is data to test with lineTrajDecode.m

The mat is 3d the 3rd d being different events

for each event, run these lines (event_reconstruction is the pMat matrix). 

event_reconstruction = t2POS_popVect_pMat(:,:,i);

  nanInd = find(~isnan(event_reconstruction(1,:)));
    zeroInd = find(sum(event_reconstruction) > 0);
    bins2use = intersect(nanInd,zeroInd);
   pMat = event_reconstruction(:,min(bins2use):max(bins2use));
    pMat(isnan(pMat)) = 0;

then try the decoding on the resulting matrix
