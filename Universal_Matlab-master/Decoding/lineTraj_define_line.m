function [tstLn, tstLnBnd]   =lineTraj_define_line(szPM2, spd2Test, yRange)
% Function primarily called by lineTrajDecode used to define the line
% (tstLn) and mask around that line (tstLnBnd) that are tested against each
% posterior. 
%
% This was an inline function but now need to access it with other
% functions - basically to get a copy of the line mask that best fits the
% pcPosterior to check against the grid posterior.
%
% Define line and band - y extent of line is equivalent to gradient *
% size(pMat,2) + the  band width. Define that line as a set of 1s in
% a mat of zeros. Then expand to include the band by il_filter2 with a
% kernel of the band width. Note always build the line as a +vs gradient
% and flip if gradient is -ve
%
% ARGS
% szPM2         size of the j dim of pMat (i.e. size(pMat,2))
%
% spd2Test      gradient of line to build defined in terms of sBins per
%               tBin (dim1 of the pMat being spatial and dim2 time)
%
% yRange        Define size of 'band' around line that is used to 
%               calculated it's goodness of fit. This value should be an 
%               integer and indicates the number of bins above and below 
%               (in the y-axis) that are counted. Must be >0 and should be 
%               an an number
