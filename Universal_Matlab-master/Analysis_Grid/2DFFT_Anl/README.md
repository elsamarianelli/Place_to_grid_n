#2DFFT_Anl

This code is my own version of Julia Krupic's two 2D FFT analysis she used to identify bandy cells. Rewritten for understanding, to test rigour and for speed. Useful for finding the primary periodic components of a spatial ratemap. 

Basic steps are to do the 2D FFT then convert into polar space. This code is still fairly experimental though. The best function to start with is *main_spatial_fft2.m*
